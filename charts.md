# üìà Financial Performance Charts

These charts illustrate monthly departmental financial performance across categories like Sales, Marketing, Operations, and IT. Based on a dataset of over 140 entries, each data point includes Expenses, Revenue, Profit, and Profit Margin, broken down by month and department from January 2023 to December 2024.

The visualizations were created in Jupyter Notebook using Python libraries such as **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**.
